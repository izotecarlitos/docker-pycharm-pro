### Notes

You'll still need a license to use the application!

The IDE will have access to Python 2 and 3 both and to Git as well.
Project folders need to be mounted like `-v ~/Project:/home/developer/Project`.
The actual name can be anything - I used something random to be able to start multiple instances if needed.

To use `pip` (or `pip3`) either use the terminal in PyCharm or install from the terminal from inside the container like `docker exec -it pycharm-running bash` then install using **pip**.
